COMS 336 Project Proposal

Our project proposal is to create a scene modelling a basic water surface. The scene will include a skybox, 
a directional light simulating the sun, an ellipsoid, and a plane to represent the water.
The surface of the plane will be modelled to look like a shifting water surface and will move up and down around the 
ellipsoid to imitate small, level waves at a beach.
